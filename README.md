fernvenue's custom PBR (Policy Based Routing) rules collection. 

All configuration files are written according to the standards in the [Policy-Based Routing OpenWrt Package Documentation: Custom User Files](https://docs.openwrt.melmac.net/pbr/1.1.8/#CustomUserFiles) and have been tested on OpenWrt.

## Usage

Just simply download the rule file from [src](./src/), and replace the `TARGET_INTERFACE` with your specific outbound interface. You can also go check my blog: [Using PBR to Route Traffic on OpenWrt](https://blog.fernvenue.com/archives/using-pbr-to-route-traffic-on-openwrt/).
